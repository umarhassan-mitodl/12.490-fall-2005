"Classic" Petrologic Localities
-------------------------------

The following list consists of selected "classic" petrologic localities. These localities are noteworthy because someone has chosen to do detailed petrologic/geochemical work there and because this work has had an important influence on petrology. You are expected to become familiar with these localities. The process of familiarization should include the following for each locality:

1.  Geographic location and areal extent.
2.  Geologic setting, age and relation to tectonic features.
3.  Dominant rock type(s) and range of rock types present.
4.  Distinctive structural, mineralogical and/or chemical features of the igneous rocks.
5.  Historical context, role in evolution of thought, authors of the important papers and major conclusions.

You should also think out for yourself the petrologic significance of each locality. For the older and more classic localities, you will be able to find summary descriptions in Carmichael, Turner and Verhoogen (1974), and even Bowen (1928) or Daly (1933) (see {{% resource_link 5fa1e7f7-7000-f310-86cb-b9fc83d4d587 "readings" %}}). For these localities, secondary references will be sufficient and you don't have to read the treatises that were originally published. For other cases, you will want to refer to original work.
